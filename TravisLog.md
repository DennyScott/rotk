#Debate
##October 27, 2014

First day of the project!  Today is both the most awesome day and the most worrying as I don't know what will be completed by weeks end, but I'm super pumped for it!  So first off I should say, I write a lot like I talk, so you may see a lot of improper grammer.  I apologize, but that's just the way it is. 

Now the game we are constructing is a little tabletop kind of game that can be found in Romance of the Three Kingdoms 10, which is the best RotK there is.  Now this game takes place in the form of the debate, and the characters yell things at each other while the debate goes on, which is some of the most terribly bad translations to an english argument you will ever see.  Anyways, this board as combos which include getting a solid color row, which will damage your opponent, which heals you.  If you get three different colors, it will do damage to yourself.  Thats the basic game, and the nit gets more complicated with different abilities that can be used.  I won't really go into details of the skills, but I will make a post of what they do shortly, but what you need to know is that they each do something to affect the flow of the game.  Nothing extreme, but enough to make you re-adjust strategies.  I apologize as I'm not going to go into full details of how the game works, you can just google it find it it anyways, but this game will be out at the end of the week for everyone to try, so you can learn it then!

 So today I made the basic flow of the game boot sequence and asset loading while Denny constructed our build process for our server.  After this I focused on getting a card selection screen ready, which amounted to a couple of text areas as well as some simple images of little red square that complete all the logic these 'cards' need to have, but have no real information displayed with them.  These items will be bought with using your budget.  This part is defferent from RotK 10, as there you can have all abilities.  This is a specific part Denny and I felt was unbalanced, because by allowing everyone to grab everything, ability cards become by far the most powerful thing, and competing on the board becomes a secondary thought.  This itself happened in RotK 10, where wonce you got all the skills, you made all opponents go crying to their mamas before you had to even play just a regular command.  We are hoping to balance this somewhat!

 So bit of a long post, but I will get some screen shots of progress for the next post!

 Now this proabably looks weird as these were psoted on the same day. I didn't acutally get around to setting up a blog yet when writing these, so they actually just sit in an MD file in the projects github while I go.  Once a blog has been set up, which at the time of writing this it has not, these blogs will be simplier, as well as more detailed, when I write them.  So anyhow, what was done today.  Well today was a lot of refactoring, as well as almost finishing the card slection screen.  This might make it sound like I'm going slow, but actually a lot of the physical card logic is now going to be ready for the game.  Also Denny is actually coding the logic for the board part of the game, so I'll let him talk about that.  For me, The cards now display porperly on the screen, but I'm going to rework a lot of the assets I have running in the menu, as well as the background color I use throughout the game, as its all actually assets I'm using from when I was reading the Discover Meteor Book by Thomas Palef, and I used them to quickly get up some of the stuff that didn't seem as important to me to begin with.

Other then that I have been refactoring a lot, trying to make the code more readable.  Remember anyone can check out this game at my github!  I had very little time today I could work on the project, I'm hoping to get more in the next couple days to really get going on this!  Other then that though, the plan tomorrow is to finish up the last of the assets needed for the Card Selection page, such as a next button, a quantity counter for the amount of a given card you chose, as well as perhaps help text of some sort.  I have been thinking more and more that I will need a tutorial of some sort, so we'll see what kind of time I have before weeks end.  I've only been able to work on this so far for a grand total of like 5 hours, so if I could get a good solid day of work on this coming up, that would be awesome!  Well check back for another blog post later!
